The `dsa-ou` organisation aggregates repositories related to M269,
the [algorithms and data structures course](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269)
of the Open University in the UK.

While the repositories mainly provide tools for M269 students and tutors,
we hope others find them useful too. To help adoption,
the code and text of each repository has usually a permissive licence.

Everyone is most welcome to contribute to any repository by
reporting issues and participating in the discussion fora.
However, we're only accepting pull requests from M269 students,
to help them practice software development skills and
build a portfolio of open source contributions.
